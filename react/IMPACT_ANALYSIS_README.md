## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `supply-lens` directory:

```bash
# Copy the template
cp env.template .env

# Edit the .env file and add your Groq API key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_groq_api_key_here
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_groq_api_key_here
```

### 2. API Key Setup

1. Sign up for a Groq account at [https://console.groq.com/](https://console.groq.com/)
2. Generate an API key from your dashboard
3. Add the key to your `.env` file

### 3. Running the Application

```bash
cd supply-lens
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How to Use

### 1. Create a Supply Chain
- Navigate to "Create Supply Chain"
- Define your product and checkpoints
- Set up transportation links

### 2. Run Simulation
- Go to "Supply Chain Visualization"
- Click transport icons to break links
- Submit simulation for analysis

### 3. View AI Analysis
- The system automatically calls Groq API
- Comprehensive analysis is generated
- View detailed insights and recommendations

## API Integration Details

### Groq API Configuration
